# Network_Simulator
•This project has two programs: graph generator and network simulator. 
•Graph generator should always generate a network of 150 nodes, with randomly-determined number of edges. Each edge has random bandwidth and delay. The graph should be connected.  
•Each node should have limited input queue, limited output queue and routing table. Finding the shortest path from each source-destination pairs stores in routing table. 
•Network simulator should load the graph, and randomly select 20 source-destination pairs for your network flow. Then, simulate packets and 1000 seconds of network activity. 
•Collect statistics data about the packet loss rate for each pair, the average delay for a packet, and total number of packets which reach destination successfully.
